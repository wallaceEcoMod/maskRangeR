<font size="4">
*maskRangeR* is an R package that refines species distribution models (SDMs) to improve estimates of species' current ranges in several ways:

  - spatiotemporally matching in-situ observations of species’ occurrence with environmental and/or remotely sensed data (e.g., MODIS-derived) to assess tolerances
  
  - directly incorporating expert knowledge of species' ranges
  
  - sequential masking of driving environmental variable tolerances 
  
  - accounting for competitive interactions

Refined range maps can be considered as improved representations of a species' realized distribution, aiding in conservation decision-making.

Additionally, *maskRangeR* will soon be available as several modules for [*Wallace*](https://wallaceecomod.github.io/); a user-friendly R application for species distribution modeling that provides guidance towards following best-practices at each step of the process. This application makes state-of-the-art modeling tools accessible and transparent to users without having to rely on computer coding skills.

## **Vignette**

### **Training materials**
<font size="4">Also in development are training materials and best practices for modeling species' niches and distributions in biodiversity change indicator assessments for the expanded *Wallace* in both English and Spanish. Materials will be web-based and openly available. They will be available as both guidance text within *Wallace* and also published as part of an open source teaching module for the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation at the American Museum of Natural History ([CBC-AMNH](https://www.amnh.org/our-research/center-for-biodiversity-conservation)) Network of Conservation Educators and Practitioners ([NCEP](https://www.amnh.org/our-research/center-for-biodiversity-conservation/capacity-development/ncep)). NCEP is a global initiative that seeks to improve the availability and quality of conservation education and professional training.</font>


## **BioModelos and *Wallace* integration**
<font size="4">The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network ([GEO-BON](https://geobon.org/)) works to improve the communication of biodiversity measurements to decision makers and the broader scientific community. To locally serve regional scientific and political communities, GEO-BON has implemented a [BON-in-a-Box](https://geobon.org/bon-in-a-box/) service that delivers customizable online toolkits for enhancing biodiversity observation systems.

[*BioModelos*](http://biomodelos.humboldt.org.co/) is a BON-in-a-box tool for Colombia’s BON. *BioModelos* bridges  modeling and taxonomy experts by facilitating occurrence record curation, model editing, suitable ecological variable identification, and providing a model vetting process. 

The integration of *BioModelos* and *Wallace* leverages the expert knowledge available in *BioModelos* with the easy-to-use interface and expert modeling tools of *Wallace*. Registered users are able to import expert-verified occurrence records and range maps, and have the ability to push SDMs and further-refined range maps back to *BioModelos.*

This synergistic relationship allows conservation practitioners to access important model statistics (indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services) such as: extent of occurrence, proportion of range under protected status, and projected change in future scenarios.

*maskRangeR* package development was funded by the NASA ROSES award No. 80NSSCK0406 to collaboratively improve the utility of the Colombia BON-in-a-Box toolkit as well as build capacity for conservation practitioners and educators.
